## Roadmap
### Phase 1
- [ ] Instruction format - this will generally define what operations the CPU will need to support (or more specifically, what it won't need to support)
- [ ] Infrastructure planning - registers, ALU operations, I/O (GPIO, DMA, etc.), communication I/O (UART, etc.)
- [ ] Von Neumann or Modified Harvard Architecture?
