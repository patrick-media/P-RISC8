# P-RISC8
P-RISC8 is an in-progress attempt at making an 8-bit RISC-style CPU (MPU may be more applicable). It will be written in Verilog and compiled/interpreted using [Icarus Verilog](https://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog).
<br/><br/>
## Roadmap
### Phase 1
- [ ] Instruction format - this will generally define what operations the CPU will need to support (or more specifically, what it won't need to support)
- [ ] Infrastructure planning - registers, ALU operations, I/O (GPIO), built-in standardized I/O (UART, etc.)
- [ ]
